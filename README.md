# todo2

This is 2nd version of the todo list.
It's not working properly.
It gets what user inputs, creates list items and show them on the html, adds the red linethrough class when user clicks
on an item, removes the red linethrough class when user clicks again.
I added functions to save in localStorage and get items from localStorage, those are working,
but I could not make it delete the items from the list.
